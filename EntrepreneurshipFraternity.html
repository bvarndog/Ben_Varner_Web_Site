					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>In early 2008, a group of like-minded individuals at the University of Dayton saw the opportunity to design a unique coed fraternal organization built upon the ideals of entrepreneurship. These early Founders realized the great potential in building such a network as entrepreneurship is one of the fastest growing majors on college campuses and a strong trend among young professionals. Later that year on April 18, 2008, Epsilon Nu Tau, the Nation’s First Entrepreneurship Fraternity was established. ENT is based upon a professional and entrepreneurial mindset, with fellowship and community as its backbone. Epsilon Nu Tau has been in operation for more than three years and has most recently launched its Epsilon Chapter at Ohio University in Athens, OH. Current plans include launching additional chapters during 2011, with more on the way for 2012. As the ENT network grows, members shall benefit from enhanced collaboration, connections, and brotherly love between chapters across the US and beyond.</p>
